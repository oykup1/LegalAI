# LegalAI

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline powered by FAISS for vector search, Ollama for local LLM inference, and a FastAPI backend that processes and indexes uploaded contracts.

This is an AI-powered system that helps automate contract analysis. Instead of manually reading through dozens of pages, this app can extract clauses, summarize them, and later compare contracts to highlight differences and biases.
